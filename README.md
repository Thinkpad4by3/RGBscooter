# RGBscooter
Rainbow animated light-up scooter

# How it works
It has two Dotstar(APA102) LED light strips attached on either side by 3d printed light mounts. These are ziptied to the lights and double-sided taped on to the scooter frame. These are then wired up to an arduino in its own 3d printed housing to power and control the lights. There is also a LiPo battery and PowerBoost control board inside for the Arduino and lights.
